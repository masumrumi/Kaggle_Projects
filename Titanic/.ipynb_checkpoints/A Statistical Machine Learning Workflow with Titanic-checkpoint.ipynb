This theory aligns with one other correlation which is the correlation between Fare and Pclass(-0.6). This relationship can be explained by saying that first class passenger(1) paid more for fare then second class passenger(2), similarly second class passenger paid more than the third class passenger(3). This theory can also be supported by mentioning another Pclass correlation with our dependent variable, Survived. The correlation between Pclass and Survived is -0.33.

However, when we do statistical tests, we get a scientific or mathematical perspective of how significant these results are. Let's apply some of the trials and see how we are doing with our predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Hypothesis Testing Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothesis test compares the mean of a control group and experimental group and tries to find out whether the two sample means are different from each other and if they are different, how significant that difference is.\n",
    " \n",
    "A **hypothesis test** usually consists of multiple parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Formulate a well-developed research problem or question: The hypothesis test usually starts with a concrete and well-developed researched problem. We need to ask the right question that can be answered using statistical analyses. \n",
    "2. The null hypothesis ($H_0$) and Alternating hypothesis($H_1$):\n",
    "> * The **null hypothesis($H_0$)** is something that is assumed to be true. It is the status quo. In a null hypothesis, the observations are the result of pure chance. When we set out to experiment, we form the null hypothesis by saying that there is no difference between the means of the control group and the experimental group.\n",
    "> *  An **Alternative hypothesis($H_A$)** is a claim and the opposite of the null hypothesis.  It is going against the status quo. In an alternative theory, the observations show a real effect combined with a component of chance variation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Determine the **test statistic**: test statistic can be used to assess the truth of the null hypothesis. Depending on the standard deviation we either use t-statistics or z-statistics. In addition to that, we want to identify whether the test is a one-tailed test or two-tailed test. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Specify a **Significance level**: The significance level($\\alpha$) is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true. In other words, we are ***comfortable/confident*** with rejecting the null hypothesis a significant amount of times even though it is true. This considerable amount is our Significant level. In addition to that significance level is one minus our Confidence interval. For example, if we say, our significance level is 5%, then our confidence interval would be (1 - 0.05) = 0.95 or 95%. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Compute the **T-statistics**: Computing the t-statistics follows a simple equation. This equation slightly differs depending on one sample test or two sample test  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Compute the **P-value**: P-value is the probability that a test statistic at least as significant as the one observed would be obtained assuming that the null hypothesis was correct. The p-value is known to be unintuitive, and even many professors are known to explain it wrong. I think this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4KCfcVwzyw) explains the p-value well. **The smaller the P-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.**\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Describe the result and compare the p-value with the significance value($\\alpha$)**: If p<= $\\alpha$, then the observed effect is statistically significant, the null hypothesis is ruled out, and the alternative hypothesis is valid. However if the p> $\\alpha$, we say that, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Even though this sentence is grammatically wrong, it is logically right. We never accept the null hypothesis just because we are doing the statistical test with sample data points.\n",

Which is almost impossible and if we were to go that route; there is no point of doing statistics in the first place. Therefore we approach this problem using sample sets. The idea of using sample set is that; if we take multiple samples of the same population and take the mean of them and put them in a distribution; eventually our distribution start to look more like a **normal distribution**. The more samples we take and the more sample means with be added and the closer the normal distribution with reach towards population mean. This is where **Central limit theory** comes from. We will go into this topic later on. \n",
