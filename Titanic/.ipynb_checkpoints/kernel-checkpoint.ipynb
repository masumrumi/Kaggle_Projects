    "This kernel is for all aspiring data scientists to learn from and to review their knowledge. We will have a detailed statistical analysis of Titanic data set along with Machine learning model implementation. I am super excited to share my first kernel with the Kaggle community. As I go on in this journey and learn new topics, I will incorporate them with each new updates. So, check for them and please <b>leave a comment</b> if you have any suggestions to make this kernel better!! Going back to the topics of this kernel, I will do more in-depth visualizations to explain the data, and the machine learning classifiers will be used to predict passenger survival status.\n",

Now, how can we determine that machine is actually learning what we are try to teach? That is where the test set comes to play. We withhold part of the data where we know the output/result of each datapoints, and we use this data to test the trained models.  We then compare the outcomes to determine the performance of the algorithms. If you are a bit confused thats okay. I will explain more as we keep reading. Let's take a look at sample datasets."

There is a definite positive correlation between Fare and Survived rated. This relationship reveals that the passenger who paid more money for their ticket were more likely to survive. This theory aligns with one other correlation which is the correlation between Fare and Pclass(-0.6). This relationship can be explained by saying that first class passenger(1) paid more for fare then second class passenger(2), similarly second class passenger paid more than the third class passenger(3). This theory can also be supported by mentioning another Pclass correlation with our dependent variable, Survived. The correlation between Pclass and Survived is -0.33. This can also be explained by saying that first class passenger had a better chance of surviving than the second or the third and so on.\n",

    "\n",
    "Statistical tests are the scientific way to prove the validation of theories. In any case, when we look at the data, we seem to have an intuitive understanding of where data is leading us. However, when we do statistical tests, we get a scientific or mathematical perspective of how significant these results are. Let's apply some of these methods and see how we are doing with our predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Hypothesis Testing Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothesis test compares the mean of a control group and experimental group and tries to find out whether the two sample means are different from each other and if they are different, how significant that difference is.\n",
    " \n",
    "A **hypothesis test** usually consists of multiple parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Formulate a well-developed research problem or question: The hypothesis test usually starts with a concrete and well-developed researched problem. We need to ask the right question that can be answered using statistical analysis. \n",
    "2. **The null hypothesis($H_0$) and Alternating hypothesis($H_1$)**:\n",
    "> * The **null hypothesis($H_0$)** is something that is assumed to be true. It is the status quo. In a null hypothesis, the observations are the result of pure chance. When we set out to experiment, we form the null hypothesis by saying that there is no difference between the means of the control group and the experimental group.\n",
    "> *  An **Alternative hypothesis($H_A$)** is a claim and the opposite of the null hypothesis.  It is going against the status quo. In an alternative theory, the observations show a real effect combined with a component of chance variation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Determine the **test statistic**: test statistic can be used to assess the truth of the null hypothesis. Depending on the standard deviation we either use t-statistics or z-statistics. In addition to that, we want to identify whether the test is a one-tailed test or two-tailed test. [This](https://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab/18/help-and-how-to/statistics/basic-statistics/supporting-topics/basics/null-and-alternative-hypotheses/) article explains it pretty well. [This](https://stattrek.com/hypothesis-test/hypothesis-testing.aspx) article is pretty good as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Specify a **Significance level** and **Confidence Interval**: The significance level($\\alpha$) is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true. In other words, we are ***comfortable/confident*** with rejecting the null hypothesis a significant amount of times even though it is true. This considerable amount is our Significant level. In addition to that, Significance level is one minus our Confidence interval. For example, if we say, our significance level is 5%, then our confidence interval would be (1 - 0.05) = 0.95 or 95%. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Compute the **T-Statistics/Z-Statistics**: Computing the t-statistics follows a simple equation. This equation slightly differs depending on one sample test or two sample test  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Compute the **P-value**: P-value is the probability that a test statistic at least as significant as the one observed would be obtained assuming that the null hypothesis is correct. The p-value is known to be unintuitive, and even many professors are known to explain it wrong. I think this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4KCfcVwzyw) explains the p-value well. **The smaller the P-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.**\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Describe the result and compare the p-value with the significance value($\\alpha$)**: If p<=$\\alpha$, then the observed effect is statistically significant, the null hypothesis is ruled out, and the alternative hypothesis is valid. However if the p> $\\alpha$, we say that, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Even though this sentence is grammatically wrong, it is logically right. We never accept the null hypothesis just because we are doing the statistical test with sample data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow each of these steps above to do your hypothesis testing below.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Specify the significance level:\n",
    "> Specifying a significance level is an important step of the hypothesis test. It is an ultimate balance between type 1 error and type 2 error. We will discuss more in-depth about those in another lesson. For now, we have decided to make our significance level($\\alpha$) = 0.05. So, our confidence interval or non-rejection region would be (1 - $\\alpha$)=(1-0.05) = 95%. \n",

    "Now, we have to understand that those two means are not  **the population mean ($\\bar{\\mu}$)**.  *The population mean is a statistical term statistician uses to indicate the actual average of the entire group. The group can be any gathering of multiple numbers such as animal, human, plants, money, stocks.* For example, To find the age population mean of Bulgaria; we will have to account for every single person's age and take their age. Which is almost impossible and if we were to go that route; there is no point of doing statistics in the first place. Therefore we approach this problem using sample sets. The idea of using sample set is that; if we take multiple samples of the same population and take the mean of them and put them in a distribution; eventually the distribution start to look more like a **normal distribution**. The more samples we take and the more sample means will be added and, the closer the normal distribution will reach towards population mean. This is where **Central limit theory** comes from. We will go more in depth of this topic later on. \n",

Once we train our algorithm using 2/3 of the train data, we start to test our algorithms using the remaining data. If the model performs well we dump our test data in the algorithms to predict and submit the competition.

    "**Gridsearch** is a simple concept but effective technique in Machine Learning. The word **GridSearch** stands for the fact that we are searching for optimal parameter/parameters over a \"grid.\" These optimal parameters are also known as **Hyperparameters**. **The Hyperparameters are model parameters that are set before fitting the model and determine the behavior of the model.**. For example, when we choose to use linear regression, we may decide to add a penalty to the loss function such as Ridge or Lasso. These penalties require specific alpha (the strength of the regularization technique) to set beforehand. The higher the value of alpha, the more penalty is being added. GridSearch finds the optimal value of alpha among a range of values provided by us, and then we go on and use that optimal value to fit the model and get sweet results. It is essential to understand those model parameters are different from models outcomes, for example, **coefficients** or model evaluation metrics such as **accuracy score** or **mean squared error** are model outcomes and different than hyperparameters.\n",

    "So, we have our first model and its score. But, how do we make sure that our model is performing well. Our model may be overfitting or underfitting. In fact, for those of you don't know what overfitting and underfitting is, Let's find out.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://cdncontribute.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/fittings.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you see in the chart above. **Underfitting** is when the model fails to capture important aspects of the data and therefore introduces more bias and performs poorly. On the other hand, **Overfitting** is when the model performs too well on the training data but does poorly in the validation set or test sets.  This situation is also known as having less bias but more variation and perform poorly as well. Ideally, we want to configure a model that performs well not only in the training data but also in the test data. This is where **bias-variance tradeoff** comes in. When we have a model that overfits, meaning less biased and more of variance, we introduce some bias in exchange of having much less variance. One particular tactic for this task is regularization models (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net).  These models are built to deal with the bias-variance tradeoff. This [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/underfitting-and-overfitting) explains this topic well. Also, the following chart gives us a mental picture of where we want our models to be. \n",
    "![](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/docs/BiasVariance/biasvariance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we want to pick a sweet spot where the model performs well in training set, validation set, and test set. As the model gets complex, bias decreases, variance increases. However, the most critical part is the error rates. We want our models to be at the bottom of that **U** shape where the error rate is the least. That sweet spot is also known as **Optimum Model Complexity(OMC).**\n",

However, don't let that fool you to thinking that similar to a decision tree, bagging also overfits the model. Instead, bagging reduces overfitting since a lot of the sample training data are repeated and used to create base estimators. With a lot of equally likely training data, bagging is not very susceptible to overfitting with noisy data, therefore reduces variance.
